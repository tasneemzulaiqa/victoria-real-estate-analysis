    "# Nearest supermarket, train station & CBD\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "Compute proximity of properties to key amenities and Melbourne CBD. This pipeline uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) and routing APIs (OpenRouteService or Google Maps) to determine the nearest amenities and driving distances/times for accessibility analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs\n",
    "- Domain property dataset: `domain_cleaned.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "- Nearest amenities for each property: `property_nearest_amenities.csv`\n",
    "- Driving distances and times from each property to:\n",
    "  - Each nearest amenity\n",
    "  - Melbourne CBD\n",
    "  Saved as: `property_with_distances_copy.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps\n",
    "1. Load properties as a DataFrame.\n",
    "2. For each amenity type:\n",
    "   - Query OSM via Overpass API within a search radius (e.g., 3 km).\n",
    "   - Retrieve nearest amenity coordinates per property.\n",
    "   - Handle rate-limits and timeouts with retries.\n",
    "3. Aggregate amenity data per property (pivot table):\n",
    "   - Each property has separate columns for each amenity type’s latitude and longitude.\n",
    "4. Compute driving distance and duration:\n",
    "   - To each nearest amenity.\n",
    "   - To Melbourne CBD (Flinders Street coordinates).\n",
    "   - Use batch-safe calls to OpenRouteService or Google Maps Distance Matrix.\n",
    "   - Handle API rate limits and retries.\n",
    "5. Save outputs incrementally to CSV to allow resuming after interruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "- Pipeline supports resuming from partially processed CSVs.\n",
    "- Distances are in meters, durations in seconds.\n"
